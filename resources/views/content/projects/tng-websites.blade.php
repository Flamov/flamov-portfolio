	<p>This project covers the <a href="#tng-fintech-website">TNG Fintech Website</a> and <a href="#tng-website">TNG Website</a>, two responsive, multi-language websites incorporating interactive 3D and 2D elements to present information, respectively. For both websites I was responsible all front-end development, creative direction, and project management.</p>

	<p>Lorem ipsum.</p>

	<h3 id="tng-website">TNG Website</h3>

	<p>The TNG Website was the accompanying website for the mobile app. It contained information such as feature details, news and press releases, and a customer support knowledge base and ticket submission system. The website was fully responsive, supported three languages, SEO-optimised, and was compatible with IE7, Android 4.2, and above.</p>

	<p>The centrepiece of the website was the 'Global Transfer' page, an interactive 2D map displaying the countries where the app was supported. Arguably the most complicated part of the website, <span class="highlight">the total page size was only 180 KB</span>. This was achieved by compiling JavaScript using the <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">Google Closure Compiler</a>, utilizing gzip compression, compressing SVG path instruction data and writing it directly to the page to reduce the number of HTTP requests.</p>

		@slot('caption', 'The interactive map was built using a multi-layered SVG, JavaScript, and CSS3 transitions &amp; transformations.')
	@endcomponent

	<p>The page was built by producing a multi-layered SVG and dividing a path for each country from the world path. The world path was then stored in the database, along with the path instructions and for each counrty and relevant information.</p>

	<p>CSS selectors and JavaScript event listeners were added to the country paths, with CSS declarations changing SVG attributes such as <code>fill</code> to control the path colours. Panning and scaling was done using CSS <code>transform</code>, namely <code>translate</code> and <code>scale</code>, with the values being calculated by JavaScript. Smooth transitions were achieved by using <code>translateZ</code> for hardware-accelerated transitions and <code>will-change</code> for ahead-of-time browser optimizations.</p>

	<p>A more detailed and technical write-up on the development of the page <a href="{{ $project->url_article }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">can be found here</a>.</p>

	@endcomponent

	<p>The front-page featured a hero section that was reguarly updated for major events or press releases. We mainly used SVGs and CSS3 transitions to create eye-catching and light-weight designs.</p>

			For the licensing announcement, we drew a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilloch%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">guilloch√© pattern</a> in Illustrator, exported it as an SVG, and animated each line with JavaScript and CSS3.

	<p>A custom-built customer support knowledge base was developed using Zend, MySQL, and Apache Solr and Lucene. Customers could search for support articles in all languages supported on the website, view related articles and article categories, and submit support tickets.</p>

		@slot('caption', 'Using Apache Solr and utilizing Apache Lucene\'s resulted in intelligent keyword and phrase-matching, providing accurate and reliable search results for all three languages used on the website.')
	@endcomponent

	<p>Support ticket submission was integrated with the company's internal JIRA system. Submitting a ticket would automatically create a JIRA ticket with the appropriate details, and provide the customer with an email and in-app notification of their ticket reference number for future follow-up.</p>
